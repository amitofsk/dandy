<h3>Testing Log</h3>
This file will contain notes about the hardware setups I've tested on. It will include relevant version numbers for python and some libraries.
<br><br>
<li>7-6-23 I tested the asyncio4.py file on a windows machine, and it worked. More specifically, I used one of the University machines in FA212 which had Python 3.8.5 and Tk version 8.6.9. I used idle. I installed pyserial 3.5 using pip. This example involved a RPi Pico sending signals over USB to the windows machine and used asyncio. </li>
<li>7-1-23 I'm starting on my home Linux machine. It has Python version 3.8.10, Tk version 8.6.10, and Idle version 3.8.10. The machine runs Ubuntu 20.04.1 with Linux version 5.15.0-73.</li>
