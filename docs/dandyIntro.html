<h3>Introduction</h3>
<br><br>
What is Dandy?<br>
I plan to write a set of reusable python examples or a library of python functions to help display sensor data in a graphical user interface (GUI).
<br><br>
What am I building?<br>
Here's a typical hardware setup. A sensor is connected to a microcontroller. The microcontroller sends the sensor data to a laptop either over USB or Bluetooth. Data is displayed in a GUI on the laptop, perhaps numerically, as a needle rotating in a dial, or on a chart plot. 
<br>
All of these steps can be implemented using existing open software, but some steps are easier than others. For example, Arduino makes writing the microcontroller software easy, and Tkinter and Qt are user-friendly libraries for writing GUIs. Where are the challenges in writing the software? First, the code for the microcontroller and the code for the GUI on the laptop are typically written in different languages. Multiple languages are not a problem for an experienced coder, but they are an obstacle for a novice or a hobbyist. Second, libraries for writing GUI software typically have reusable widgets like buttons and sliders, but they don't have ones made specifically for handling inputs from analog sensors. Third, the software on the laptop has to both continually read from the sensors and continually update the GUI. These should appear to the user to happen simultaneously, without either task blocking the other. 
<br>
The goal of this project is not to show a new application of sensors. Instead, it is to make writing software for this typical setup easier. More specifically, I plan to write a set of reusable examples that show how to solve the problems described above. These examples will use MicroPython for the microcontroller code and Python for laptop code. The GUI will be written using Tkinter and will show example reusable widgets for displaying the analog sensor data.

Who is this project for?<br>
This project has tutorials and widgets to help you connect sensors, a microcontroller, and a computer. It aims to simplify the step of writing Python code for displaying the sensor data.
<br>
Here's who this project is not for ... This library is intended to be used by Python programmers. If you haven't programmed before or haven't programmed in Python, this library isn't for you. This library is intended to help you connect your hardware and your computer quickly but in an unpolished way. It doesn't involve real time operating systems. Also, it isn't for highly customizable and polished products. You'll want more developed tools for that task.
<br><br>
What are the requirements?<br>
According to <a href="https://realpython.com/async-io-python/">https://realpython.com/async-io-python/</a>, the asyncIO functionality in python is relatively new. It has rapidly advanced from Python 3.4 to 3.7. For this reason, I recommend you use at least Python version 3.7.
